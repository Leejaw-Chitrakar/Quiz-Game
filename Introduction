Project: Interactive Quiz Game
Made by: Leejaw Chitrakar, Samit Shrestha and Rijan Shrestha
Objective: To create an engaging and interactive quiz game that tests users' knowledge of various subjects, allowing for a fun and educational experience.

The Interactive Quiz and Number Guessing Game were developed by a team of students, including Leejaw Chitrakar, Samit Shrestha, and Rijan Shrestha as part of a collaborative project 
aimed at honing our programming skills and offering an engaging experience to users. The project provides two games on a single platform: a Quiz Game and a Number Guessing Game. 
Each game offers a unique way for users to challenge themselves and have fun while improving their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

Why It Was Made:
The project was created to provide an interactive experience where users could choose between two types of games: a knowledge-based quiz or a logical number-guessing game. 
The goal was to engage users in a fun and educational way, offering different types of challenges through games. 
By combining two distinct game types, we aimed to reach a wider audience and allow players to choose a game that suited their interests.

How It Was Made:
When users open the index.html file, they are presented with an introductory page where they can choose between the Number Guessing Game and the Quiz Game.
The Quiz Game was developed using HTML for the structure, CSS for the design, and JavaScript for the logic. 
It challenges players with randomized questions and keeps track of scores.
The Number Guessing Game was also built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
In this game, players must guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game gives hints (higher or lower) after each guess until the user guesses the correct number.

Challenges Faced:
For both games, the team faced a few challenges:
In the Quiz Game, the most significant challenge was randomizing the questions and answers, ensuring users couldnâ€™t memorize the patterns. 
The solution was to implement a randomization algorithm in JavaScript.
In the Number Guessing Game, the challenge was to ensure that the range of numbers was clear and that the user interface provided helpful feedback without overwhelming the player. 
We worked to balance user-friendly design with functional gameplay, such as providing feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low.

Outcome:
The final product was a fully functional game platform that allowed users to choose between two different types of games. 
Both games were designed to be user-friendly, with smooth interactions and clear instructions. 
This project helped the team learn how to integrate multiple game features into one platform and reinforced our JavaScript skills, 
particularly in handling user input, randomization, and event-driven programming.
