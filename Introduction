Project: Interactive Quiz Game
Made by: Leejaw Chitrakar, Samit Shrestha and Rijan Shrestha
Objective: To create an engaging and interactive quiz game that tests users' knowledge on various subjects, allowing for a fun and educational experience.

Introduction:
The Interactive Quiz Game was developed by a team of students, including Leejaw Chitrakar, Samit Shrestha and Rijan Shrestha as part of a collaborative project 
aimed at honing programming skills and creating a user-friendly application. The goal of the project was to provide a dynamic way for users 
to test their knowledge while also improving our coding abilities in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Why It Was Made:
The quiz game was created to address the need for engaging educational tools. 
With the rise of online learning and interactive content, 
We saw an opportunity to create a fun and challenging way for users to practice and test their knowledge across different subjects. 
Our main aim was to provide a resource that users could enjoy while learning, making the process both entertaining and informative.

How It Was Made:
The game was developed using HTML for the structure, CSS for the design, and JavaScript to handle the game logic, including question display, scoring, and the randomization of questions.
The interface was designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate through the quiz. 
JavaScript played a key role in creating a seamless interaction between the player and the game by ensuring smooth transitions between questions and calculating scores.

Challenges Faced:
One of the most significant challenges the team faced was randomizing the questions in such a way that the answers werenâ€™t displayed in a predictable pattern. 
Without randomization, users could easily memorize the answer sequences and cheat during multiple attempts. 
To overcome this, we spent considerable time troubleshooting and implementing a randomization algorithm in JavaScript, 
ensuring that the questions and answers appeared in a unique order with each attempt. 
This challenge taught us valuable problem-solving techniques and helped improve our teamwork and coding efficiency.

Outcome:
The final product was a fully functional quiz game that provided users with a fresh and dynamic experience every time they played. 
It was a successful project that not only met the original objectives but also allowed the team to learn more about JavaScript, web development, and teamwork. 
The project helped us better understand how to handle user interactions and optimize the game for a smooth and enjoyable experience.
